Abstract: How do large language models (LLMs) organize moral knowledge? Models detect moral content broadly, but detection is a low bar. We ask whether they go further, distinguishing moral foundations from one another and organizing the relationships between them geometrically.
  We train six independent linear probes on open-weight language models, one per Moral Foundations Theory (MFT) category (care/harm, fair/cheat, lib/oppress, loy/betray, auth/subv, sanc/degrade), and examine how the resulting directions relate to each other in representation space. We find the directions neither collapse into a single moral detector nor isolate from one another. Rather, they span a near-maximal number of independent dimensions while sharing a positive common component. The shared component is the signature of integration, and it is moral-specific relative to a matched non-moral concept battery built identically (mean pairwise cosine 0.26 vs. 0.013).
  The geometry is consistent across architectures and scale and reaches its integration regime early in pre-training, well before probe accuracy saturates. The structure the model discovers shows no evidence of the individualizing/binding distinction predicted by Moral Foundations Theory (an underpowered test: only 20 candidate partitions exist) but rather reflects corpus statistics. Extending to moral dilemmas, each dilemma direction partially composes from its component foundations, at 2.7x a mismatched-pair baseline, while the majority of its variance encodes conflict-specific structure. The model represents moral tension itself, not a pre-resolved judgment.
