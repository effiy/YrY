Abstract: An LLM call in a semantic data processing system is expensive enough to dominate query cost, yet slow enough to hide a CPU-side learner's update behind its round-trip. In production, LLM compute accounts for $80-90\%$ of query cost, and each call costs $10^5-10^7\times$ a relational predicate. The latency window inverts a design constraint of classical adaptive query processing, where online learners had to stay lightweight to avoid dominating the predicates they optimize. At LLM latency, per-call gradient steps and per-batch threshold solves fit inside the round-trip. We develop compositional online learning at the LLM call boundary: a framework for combining online-learning components in semantic data processing systems. Each component makes execution-time decisions and refines its learned artifacts online. The design space spans two axes, decision granularity and learner update cadence, and the components share a single learning pattern that hides each trainer step inside the next LLM round-trip. A production case study in Cortex AISQL composes three components: a memoization layer, an online per-call filter-ordering learner, and an online per-batch cascade-routing learner. A conditional cost decomposition assigns each learning component to a distinct factor of per-row LLM cost. Under independence, the two learning components compose multiplicatively to an $11.4\times$ upper bound on a representative conjunction-filter workload. Self-selection at the cascade boundary, sample-budget shrinkage, and selectivity-estimation drift reduce it to a realistic figure near $8\times$.
