Abstract: Clinical electroencephalography (EEG) reporting remains largely manual and time-consuming, and current EEG software ecosystems do not produce the structured EEG-text supervision needed for training modern language models. Most toolboxes focus on visualization or preprocessing, providing limited support for workflows that generate high-quality datasets for AI. We introduce EEG-to-Report, a browser-based annotation and feature-text framework that links routine EEG review with the construction of AI-ready datasets. The framework integrates multi-format EEG ingestion, channel standardization, and an interactive viewer with a multimodal annotation layer that combines typed text and transcribed voice notes. For each annotated segment, a feature extraction engine computes a standardized set of spectral, temporal, entropy, Hjorth, connectivity, and spike-related descriptors, stored alongside clinical descriptions in a portable JSON schema. This yields aligned feature-text pairs designed to supervise multimodal EEG-language models. The framework also includes an auto-report module that couples an ensemble of convolutional networks with a large language model to draft clinical narratives for neurologist review. Using pilot annotations, we describe how EEG-to-Report streamlines annotation workflows and produces editable draft reports, providing a reusable foundation for automated EEG reporting systems.
