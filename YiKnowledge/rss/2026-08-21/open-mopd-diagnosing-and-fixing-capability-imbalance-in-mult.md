Abstract: Multi-teacher on-policy distillation (M-OPD) has emerged as a promising paradigm for consolidating domain-specialized reinforcement learning (RL) experts into a single generalist student via dense, token-level reward supervision. Despite its practical success, the optimization dynamics governing multi-teacher capability integration remain poorly understood, and open, rigorously reproducible recipes are conspicuously lacking. In this work, we establish a controlled M-OPD benchmark on SmolLM3-3B-Base with oracle routing, isolating capability integration from routing ambiguity. Our investigation reveals a pronounced capability integration gap: standard M-OPD captures only 35.6% of the available headroom relative to a domain-routed oracle ensemble, with concise tasks such as instruction following suffering severe degradation and premature stagnation. Crucially, we show that this failure stems not from gradient conflict, but from a severe misallocation of the token-level optimization budget. This pathology is driven by three orthogonal factors: structural sequence-length disparities across domains, dynamic convergence drift due to non-uniform learning rates, and multi-step reward staleness from asynchronous policy updates. To resolve these imbalances, we introduce Open-MOPD, a principled framework incorporating token-share balancing, gap-aware dynamic budget allocation, and student reward refresh. Together, these mechanisms systematically restore cross-domain balance, elevating headroom recovery from 35.6% to 83.4% in a single deployable student. We fully open-source our end-to-end post-training recipe, training trajectories, and evaluation suites on an academically accessible hardware budget.
