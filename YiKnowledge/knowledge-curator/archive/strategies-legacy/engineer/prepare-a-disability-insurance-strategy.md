# I want to prepare a disability insurance strategy

> **As an** engineer, **I want to** prepare a disability insurance, **so that** launch is safe.

> "Disability insurance + short-term + long-term + Governance + Quarterly audit" reachable within 2 hops: Process + Thinking + Case study.

## Scenario description

When preparing disability insurance / short-term / long-term / Governance / promotion freeze / quarterly audit / retrospective, TL + HR + finance + business + sponsor need to look up Process + Thinking + Case study. This entry aggregates disability-insurance-related Process + Thinking + Case study into a 2-hop path, avoiding "scattered enrollment / missed claims / lapsed policies / chaotic closed loops / no quarterly audit".

## Action recommendations

1. **First principles**: first ask "what does disability insurance solve / what happens if not done / ROI / business impact"; don't enroll blindly; see [first-principles-summary.md](../../knowledge-curator/templates/thinking/first-principles.md).
2. **Inversion**: first imagine "disability could go out of control (scattered enrollment / missed claims / lapsed policies / trust collapse)" then set guardrails; see [inversion-summary.md](../../knowledge-curator/templates/thinking/inversion.md).
3. **Second-order effects**: one-shot enrollment → behavior change → another enrollment; follow [second-order-thinking-summary.md](../../knowledge-curator/templates/thinking/second-order-thinking.md).
4. **Occam**: the simplest disability plan that satisfies business wins; don't pile up insurance types; see [ockhams-razor-summary.md](../../knowledge-curator/templates/thinking/ockhams-razor.md).
5. **Enrollment**: must run enrollment / short-term / long-term + no scattering.
6. **Claims**: must run claims / validation / audit trail + no leakage.
7. **Observable**: must run observable / traceable / audit + no leakage.
8. **Closed loop**: must run closed loop / retrospective / archive + no leakage.
9. **Benefits**: must run [i-want-to-prepare-a-benefits-strategy.md](./prepare-a-benefits-strategy.md) + no naked run.
10. **Medical**: must run [i-want-to-prepare-a-healthcare-benefits-strategy.md](./prepare-a-healthcare-benefits-strategy.md) + no naked run.
11. **Mental health**: must run [i-want-to-prepare-a-mental-health-strategy.md](./prepare-a-mental-health-strategy.md) + no naked run.
12. **Total rewards**: must run [i-want-to-prepare-a-total-rewards-strategy.md](./prepare-a-total-rewards-strategy.md) + no naked run.
13. **Safety**: must run [i-want-to-prepare-a-security-strategy.md](./prepare-a-security-strategy.md) + no naked run.
14. **SSOT**: must run [ssot-view-layer-pattern.md](../../engineer/architecture-design/ssot-view-layer.md) disability library + no multi-source.
15. **Contract QA**: must run [contract-test-baseline-pattern.md](../../engineer/patterns/contract-test-baseline.md) + no naked run.
16. **RACI**: must run [raci-matrix-summary.md](../../engineer/processes/collaboration/raci-matrix.md); Platform / HR / finance / business owner.
17. **Freeze period**: during promotions use [release-freeze-process.md](../../oncall-sre/release/release-freeze.md) — do not move enrollment window.
18. **Communication**: must run [communication-cadence.md](../../knowledge-curator/people/stakeholders/communication-cadence.md) communicate internally and externally.
19. **Monitoring**: must run [monitoring-governance-process.md](../../engineer/processes/monitoring-governance.md) disability anomaly alerts.
20. **Retrospective**: after disability incident must run [retrospective-template.md](../../knowledge-curator/templates/retrospective.md) retrospective + archive [bugs/](../../engineer/lessons/failures/bugs).
21. **Quarterly audit**: follow [governance.md](../../knowledge-curator/governance/governance.md) + [review-log.md](../../knowledge-curator/governance/review-log.md) scan enrollment whether still accurate / claims whether still reasonable.
22. **ADR**: disability decision must land in ADR; see [adr-template.md](../../knowledge-curator/templates/adr.md).
23. **Flywheel**: disability done well → participation rises → trust rises → more budget; see [flywheel-effect-summary.md](../../knowledge-curator/templates/thinking/flywheel-effect.md).
